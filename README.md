## Description

This ` Portfolop App ` is a Static Single Page application that would empower hiring managers, team leads, clients, and whoever else to view my work (both first hand with the application as well as with projects in my portfolio), resume, learn more about me, as well as get into contact with me. It was bootstrapped with Create React App specifically ` CRA_5 ` as the framework and gets packed with ` Webpack_5 ` as configured with ` CRA_5 `. The Application also uses the ` Email.js ` api to send emails to me from a static site. This application was developed to show off my front end skills as a Full-Stack Developer as well as continue to build those skill and get familiar with React before taking on ` NEXT.js `. This Application is a good starting point to continue fleshing out with my projects but also to comeback to and iterate on bringing back new skills i've learned in my future projects.
